<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A user-defined name for the chat capability.
- `system_prompt` (String) The system prompt that guides the behavior of the chat model.

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) Configuration settings for the capability's behavior. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `is_public` (Boolean) Indicates whether the capability is publicly accessible. Defaults to false.
- `model_id` (String) The UUID of the model deployment to use for this capability. If not provided, a default model for 'chat' type may be used by the API.
- `project_id` (String) The UUID of the project this capability belongs to. If not provided, it might be associated with a default or no project.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the chat capability (UUID).
- `owner` (String) Owner of the capability.
- `type` (String) Type of the capability (should be 'chat').

### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `blob_config` (Attributes) Configuration for handling file uploads (blobs) if the capability supports it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--blob_config))
- `content_tracing` (Boolean) Whether content (prompts, completion data, variables) should be recorded in observability systems. Automatically set to false by the API for timed data retention.
- `data_retention` (Attributes) Defines how long execution input and output data should be kept. Configure with 'type' and optionally 'hours'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--data_retention))
- `temperature` (Number) Controls randomness in response generation (0.0 to 1.0). Higher values make output more random.

### Nested Schema for `config.data_retention`

Required:
